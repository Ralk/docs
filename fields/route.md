# Route Field

## Introduction

A route picker field that lets you select routes from a predefined collection.

## Usage

The route field requires the **name** of the [collection](#route-collection)
that should be used for this field. Additionally a **title** is required.

```php
$form->route('route')
    ->collection('app')
    ->title('Pick an Url');
```

## Route Collection

To be able to select routes in your route field you must first register a route
collection in a [service provider](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/providers). The
registered collection can then be used again and again in different places. The
following example registers a collection with the name **app**.

```php
use Ignite\Crud\Fields\Route;

Route::register('app', function($collection) {
    // Define your route collection in here.
});
```

### Add Route

The selectable routes are configured in the closure using the `route` method.
The first parameter is the **title** that represents the route followed by an
identifier and a function that returns the actual route.

```php
$collection->route('Home', 'home', function() {
    return route('home');
});
```

:::tip

Use the [arrow function](https://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.arrow.php)
short cut:

```php
$collection->route('Home', 'home', fn($locale) => route('home'));
```

### Add Group

You can group routes for example into model show routes.

```php
$collection->group('Articles', function($group) {
    $articles = Article::all();

    foreach($articles as $article) {
        $group->route($article->title, $article->id, function() use ($article) {
            return route('articles.show', $article->id));
        });
    }
});
```

### Localization

The closure in which the route is returned is given the current **locale** as
parameter.

```php
$collection->route('Home', 'home' function($locale) {
    return route("{$locale}.home");
});
```

## Prepare Model

If the route field is used in Models the route cast must be specified:

```php
use Ignite\Crud\Casts\Route;

$casts = [
    'route' => Route::class
];
```

## Frontend

You can output the value of your route directly in Blade, for example in the
**href** attribute like this:

```php
<a href="{{ $model->route }}">My Link</a>
```

You can check if the route is active:

```php
@if($model->route->isActive())
    Hello World!
@endif
```

You may use the `isActive` method to add optional classes to your link:

```php
<a
    href="{{ $model->route }}"
    class="$model->route->isActive('active-class')"
>
    My Link
</a>
```
