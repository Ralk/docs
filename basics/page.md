# Page

## Introduction

Pages are a fundamental part of the package. They provide a convenient and yet
powerfull way to configure pages for the Vue application in PHP. They can be
used to integrate **Blade Views**, **Vue components** or ready-made components
such as **charts** or form fields for models.

Pages are used to configure forms with fields, index pages, dashboards with
charts or basicly any kind of page for the admin backend.

## Create a Page

A page can be simply created by returning an instance of `Ignite\Page\Page` like
so:

```php
namespace Lit\Controllers;

use Ignite\Page\Page;

class MyPageController
{
    public function __invoke()
    {
        $page = new Page;

        return $page->title('My Page');
    }
}
```

This will show an empty page with the title `My Page`:

![Page with Title](./screens/page_title.jpg 'Page with Title')

## View

You can easily integrate your own blade components with using `view`:

```php
$page = new Page;

$page->view('hello');

return $page->title('My Page');
```

```php
<div class="col-12">
    <div class="card">
        <div class="card-body">
            <h4 class="pb-2">Hello World!</h4>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

And voila we have our first Page with content saying `Hello World!` using pure
Blade.

## Component

Just like Blade Views, Vue components can be easily integrated into your page.
To do this, the **name** of the desired Vue component must be passed as the
first parameter to the `component method:

```php
$page->component('my-component');
```

You may also pass a **prop** to the component:

```php
$page->component('my-component')->prop('color', 'green');
```

Or bind an array that should be passed as **props** to the component:

```php
$page->component('my-component')->bind([
    'title' => 'My Title',
    'color' => 'green'
]);
```

## Bind Data

You may want to bind global data to all views and components contained in the
page. This can be done by passing an array containing the data to the `bind`
method like this:

```php
$page->bind($data);
```

The data is now accessible in Blade Views and is passed to Vue components as
props. However, you might want to pass data only to Blade Views or only to Vue
components. You can use `bindToView` and `bindToVue` in that case:

```php
$page->bindToView($data);
$page->bindToVue($data);
```

## Expand

The container of your Page has a maximum width by default. However, you can
expand the container to the full width. For example, to be able to display large
tables completely.

```php
$page->expand();
```

## Slots

On a page there are different **slots** to which elements such as buttons can be
added. These slots are located in two areas:

-   **navigation** - a `sticky` bar on the top of every page
-   **header** - contains a title that describes the pages content

The following screenshot shows the existing slots and where they are located.

![navigation](./screens/page_slots.jpg 'navigation')

Views or Vue components can be added to each slot:

```php
$page->navigationLeft()->view('my_button');
$page->navigationLeft()->component('my-button');
```

### Navigation

Available slots for the **navigation** are: `left`, `right`, `controls`

```php
$page->navigationLeft();
$page->navigationRight();
$page->navigationControls();
```

### Header

Available slots for the **header** are: `left`, `right`

```php
$page->headerLeft();
$page->headerRight();
```
