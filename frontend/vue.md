# Vue

## Introduction

The admin interface can be extended with custom Vue components for numerous
purposes. This documents describes how custom Vue components can be added to the
application.

## Extend Vue

To include your own `Vue` components in the admin application, the local npm
package `vendor/litstack/litstack` has to be installed. This can be done using
the following artisan command:

```shell
php artisan lit:extend
```

At the beginning of your `webpack.mix.js` the import of the Litstack mix config
will be added automatically. Two files are compiled:

-   `lit/resources/js/app.js` => `public/lit/js/app.js`
-   `lit/resources/sass/app.scss` => `public/lit/css/app.css`

Add them to **assets** in the config.

```php{config/lit.php}
'assets' => [
    'app_js' => '/lit/js/app.js',
    'scripts' => [
        // Add more js files here ...
    ],
    'styles' => [
        // Add more css files here ...
    ],
],
```

All javascript files can be found in `lit/resources/js`.

::: tip

Components that are created in the `components` folder are automatically
registered.

:::

Run `npm run watch` and you are good to go.

::: warning

Don't forget to compile your assets every time you **update** the package.

## Register Vue Components

Vue Components that are located in the `./lit/resources/js/components` folder
are automatically globally registered. They can be used for example in Pages,
Tables or anywhere where you want to include Vue components.

## Bootstrap Vue

To make it easy to build uniform Litstack pages, the package uses
[Bootstrap Vue](https://bootstrap-vue.org/docs/components) for all frontend
components. Bootstrap Vue comes with a large number of components to cover all
the necessary areas needed to build an application.

## Mixins

-   [can](#mixin-can)
-   [user](#mixin-user)

<a name="mixin-can"></a>

### `can({permission})`

The `can` mixin checks if the authenticated user has a permission.

```js
<template v-if="can('read message')">{{ message }}</template>
```

<a name="mixin-user"></a>

### `user()`

The `user` mixin returns the authenticated User Model.

```js
<span>{{ user().name }}</span>
```

## Localization

[i18n-vue](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/docs/formatting.html) is used for
the translation in Vue. All translations that are available in **php** are
available in **i18n-vue** as well like shown in the example:

```php{lit/resources/lang/en/message.php}
return [
    "welcome": "Welcome to Litstack"
];
```

```javascript
<div>
    {{ $t('message.welcome') }}
</div>
```
